                     <p>
                        I'm a machine learning engineer at Carlson Software and graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from the University of Kentucky in May 2024. While in school, I was a member of the Lewis Honors College and double-majored in Computer Science and Mathematics.
                        My work at Carlson focuses on self-supervised learning in computer vision tasks like image segmentation and boundary detection. These techniques are applied to aerial images for use by civil engineers in our Carlson IntelliCAD application.
                        In addition to designing and training deep learning models, I've created multiple applications that enable my team to generate and label ground-truth data as well as a custom HTTP server, API, and webpages for automating and visualizing training, inference, and evaluation.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        I've previously worked as a research assistant in medical imaging and deep learning at the University of Kentucky, finding novel training methods for image segmentation models. In this capacity, I wrote a paper that was published to ISBI 2024 and presented a poster at UK's 2023 Commonwealth Computational Summit.
                        I was also a research assistant in the field of nuclear physics where I built a high-speed data acquisition system that was deployed in an experiment on the J-PARC particle accelerator. This experiment (NOPTREX) was performed to collect information about gamma radiation emissions from decaying neutrons.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Over the summers of 2022 and 2023, I interned at Lockheed Martin and Infineon Technologies. Through these internships, I gained experience building data analysis and report automation tools as well as developing physical verification rules for transistor-level devices.
                        I also spent four semesters as a teaching assistant and grader at the University of Kentucky where I graded assignments and instructed labs on topics ranging from UI development to intermediate C++ and Linux.

This game was released on Steam on December 17, 2025. <br> <br> In Shoulder-Mounted Space Program, you launch yourself from planet to planet using a rocket launcher as your only form of movement. You do your best to explore hostile regions of space while robotic enemies try to stop you. <br> <br> With two unique game modes, 15 levels where each introduces a new mechanic/enemy, and a final boss fight, Shoulder-Mounted Space Program provides a large amount of variety given its simple concept. <br> <br> To get this game ready for release, I coordinated a small group of playtesters, artists, and a composer while being the sole developer. <br> <br> Shoulder-Mounted Space Program was developed in Unity with C#.',

               'A novel reinforcement learning approach for long-term planning tasks that combines deep image analysis models with traditional tree-search algorithms. When training on strategy games, most state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches rely entirely on self-play or learning from human strategies. But, self-play leads to early versions of models making entirely random moves and takes longer to train while many tasks that require reinforcement learning don\'t have established human strategies to use when training models. This new approach, dubbed Deep-State Learning, introduces simple opponents that use hard-coded tree-search algorithms at the beginning of the training process. Later in training, the opponents alternate between mutated self-play and these simple opponents. This strategy allows the model to initially learn intelligent but simple strategies before switching to self-play, reducing the random moves inherent to early models trained with self-play. <br> <br> An experimental analysis on a custom generic strategy game shows that Deep-State Learning performs better than traditional tree-search algorithms and models trained on self-play by up to 10%. <br> <br> This work was completed as my thesis for the University of Kentucky\'s Lewis Honors College under Dr. Jerzy Jaromczyk and Dr. Neil Moore.
